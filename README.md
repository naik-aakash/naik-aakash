### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :student: I did complete my Master in Materials Science with focus Computer aided materials simulations from [Paderborn University](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/)
- :scientist: At present I am pursuing my Doctoral studies at the [Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (Bundesanstalt fÃ¼r Materialforschung und -prÃ¼fung)](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) in Berlin, Germany under supervision of [Dr.Janine George](https://github.com/JaGeo)
- ðŸ”­ I currently work on high-throughput simulations focused on bonding analysis to identify new descriptors for materials properties based on bonding indicators by employing machine learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m aspire to gain expertise in material simulations at all scales from atomistic to FEM and in applied machine learning to solve material science problems
- ðŸ“« You can to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NaikAak) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakashnaik23/)
- ðŸ’» My website will contain more info and is currently work in progress.
